            <!-- Service Objection -->
            <details class="glass-card">
                <summary>Will the posts look like they came from us?</summary>
                <p>Yes. The Post Pack includes professional templates that match modern standards. If you hire us for
                    the Growth plan, we customize everything to your brand voice and style.</p>

            <details class="glass-card">
                <summary>How much time does my team need to spend on this?</summary>
                <p>Zero to 30 minutes a month. The free pack is ready to use. Our paid plans are completely done-for-you
                    — we just need your approval on the calendar.</p>

            <!-- External Objection -->
            <details class="glass-card">
                <summary>Is this safe? What if we get negative comments?</summary>
                <p>We monitor your Google Reviews and social comments. We alert you immediately to any risks and provide
                    a draft response to neutralize the issue professionaly.</p>
            </details>
            <!-- Original Objection -->
            <details class="glass-card">
                <summary>We've tried social media agencies before.</summary>
                <p>Most agencies focus on "going viral." We focus on "building trust." We aren't trying to make you an
                    influencer; we're ensuring your business looks actively open for business.</p>
            </details>

            <!-- SEO-targeted FAQs -->
            <details class="glass-card">
                <summary>How often should a small business post on social media?</summary>
                <p>For most small businesses, 3-4 posts per week is the sweet spot. Enough to stay visible and active, without burning out. Consistency matters more than volume — a steady 3 posts per week beats 10 posts one week and silence the next.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="glass-card">
                <summary>What platforms do you post on?</summary>
                <p>We work with Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Business Profile. Most clients start with 1-2 platforms and expand from there. We recommend starting where your customers already spend time.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="glass-card">
                <summary>How long before I see results?</summary>
                <p>Most clients notice a difference in their online presence within the first 2 weeks — your pages look active, professional, and current. Measurable growth in engagement and inquiries typically shows up within 60-90 days of consistent posting.</p>
